== Context

<<Sanchez18a>> describes a scriptless scripts protocol that can be used to replace HTLCs with conditional payments based on learning a discrete logarithm (rather than a hash pre-image).
This would make atomic swaps indistinguishable from normal transactions (at least in the case where there is no refund transaction).
Luckily, we have KZen's implementation (<<kzen_multi_hop_locks>>) of <<Sanchez18b>> uses the same technique as <<Sanchez18a>> in a more complex protocol.
The purpose of this spike is to review <<Sanchez18a>>, make any important notes, and describe how we can use <<kzen_multi_hop_locks>> to implement the idea.

== Protocol Overview

Let P1 and P2 have a joint public key X = g^x~1~x~2~^ and x~1~ and x~2~ are their respective private keys and assume the following situation:

- P2 knows some value Œ± and wishes to get a signature on a message ùìÇ under the joint public key X.
- P1 knows g^Œ±^ and wants to know Œ±.

So they make a deal.
P1 will provide her half of the signature on ùìÇ as long as she is guaranteed to learn Œ± if she sees the completed signature (note that she's going to be able to see the completed signature because it will be on the blockchain).
In an HTLC, Œ± plays a similar role as the hash preimage.

== Key Generation

=== Generating the joint nonce R

When signing, like in <<Lindell17>>, P1 and P2 need to agree on a joint nonce R, except that instead of R = g^r~1~r~2~^ we have R = g^r~1~r~2~Œ±^.

First P2 sends g^Œ±^ to P1.
It is important to do this first to avoid breaking the simulation by letting P2 choose g^Œ±^ adaptively.

After that, P1 and P2 have exchange R~1~ = g^r~1~^ and R~2~ = g^r~2~^ via the usual simulatable Diffie-Hellman coin flipping in <<Lindell17>>.

Next, P2 sends R~3~ = R~2~^Œ±^ and a proof that (g^Œ±^, R~2~, R~3~) is a valid Diffie-Hellman triple.
Note, I think that he could actually just send this when he sends R~2~ during the coin flipping but I'm unsure whether the two things can happen in parallel without breaking the simulation.

The proof for a valid Diffie-Hellman triple used in <<kzen_multi_hop_locks>> works by proving knowledge of a pre-image Œ± for the one-way homomorphism h(Œ±) = (g^Œ±^, R~2~^Œ±^) through the Sigma protocol.
This proves that (g^Œ±^, R~2~, R~3~) is a valid Diffie-Hellman triple.
I found a nice explanation of this in <<Maurer09>> (section 6.6).

=== Implementation Notes

The proof is implemented here: https://github.com/KZen-networks/curv/blob/18f0081a9a3025eafd49ad496e5032647edf4aa3/src/cryptographic_primitives/proofs/sigma_ec_ddh.rs
and is non-interactive via Fiat-Shamir transform of the Sigma protocol.

== Signing

The signing protocol then continues as normal under R except at the end the `s` value for the signature that P1 has is not yet valid (it's missing Œ±).
We'll call this incomplete `s` value s~1~ (it's s'' in the paper)

P1 now sends s~1~ to P2.
P2 can now finally calculate the final s from s~1~ using his knowledge of Œ±.
Specifically s = Œ±^-1^(s~1~).

When s is revealed to P1, she can extract Œ± = s^-1^s~1~ (note in <<Sanchez18a>> the paper it says Œ± = (s(s~1~^-1^))^-1^ but this is slower).

Well almost.
The (R,s) signature that makes it into the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockhain isn't necessarily the one you will be able to extract Œ± from directly.
This is because (R, -s) is also a valid signature.
There is a soft fork proposal in Bitcoin to fix this: [BIP146](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0146.mediawiki), but we have to make sure that the code doesn't break if you receive a signature with a "high s".
This isn't mentioned in <<Sanchez18a>> but it is recognised in <<Sanchez18b>>.
You will have to try both Œ± and -Œ± to see which one is the real Œ±.

=== Implementation Notes

This will have to implemented by us, but it may be helpful to follow along withÔºöhttps://github.com/KZen-networks/multi-hop-locks to see how they did it for the multi-hop lock case.
